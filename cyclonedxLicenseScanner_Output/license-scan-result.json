How curl Became Like This
=========================

Towards the end of 1996, Daniel Stenberg was spending time writing an IRC bot
for an Amiga related channel on EFnet. He then came up with the idea to make
currency-exchange calculations available to Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
users. All the necessary data were published on the Web; he just needed to
automate their retrieval.

1996
----

On November 11, 1996 the Brazilian developer Rafael Sagula wrote and released
HttpGet version 0.1.

Daniel extended this existing command-line open-source tool. After a few minor
adjustments, it did just what he needed. The first release with Daniel's
additions was 0.2, released on December 17, 1996. Daniel quickly became the
new maintainer of the project.

1997
----

HttpGet 0.3 was released in January 1997 and now it accepted HTTP URLs on the
command line.

HttpGet 1.0 was released on April 8 1997 with brand new HTTP proxy support.

We soon found and fixed support for getting currencies over GOPHER. Once FTP
download support was added, the name of the project was changed and urlget 2.0
was released in August 1997. The http-only days were already passed.

Version 2.2 was released on August 14 1997 and introduced support to build for
and run on Windows and Solaris.

November 24 1997: Version 3.1 added FTP upload support.

Version 3.5 added support for HTTP POST.

1998
----

February 4: urlget 3.10

February 9: urlget 3.11

March 14: urlget 3.12 added proxy authentication.

The project slowly grew bigger. With upload capabilities, the name was once
again misleading and a second name change was made. On March 20, 1998 curl 4
was released. (The version numbering from the previous names was kept.)

(Unrelated to this project a company called Curl Corporation registered a US
trademark on the name "CURL" on May 18 1998. That company had then already
registered the curl.com domain back in November of the previous year. All this
was revealed to us much later.)

SSL support was added, powered by the SSLeay library.

August: first announcement of curl on freshmeat.net.

October: with the curl 4.9 release and the introduction of cookie support,
curl was no longer released under the GPL license. Now we are at 4000 lines of
code, we switched over to the MPL license to restrict the effects of
"copyleft".

November: configure script and reported successful compiles on several
major operating systems. The never-quite-understood -F option was added and
curl could now simulate quite a lot of a browser. TELNET support was added.

curl 5 was released in December 1998 and introduced the first ever curl man
page. People started making Linux RPM packages out of it.

1999
----

January: DICT support added.

OpenSSL took over and SSLeay was abandoned.

May: first Debian package.

August: LDAP:// and FILE:// support added. The curl website gets 1300 visits
weekly. Moved site to curl.haxx.nu.

September: Released curl 6.0. 15000 lines of code.

December 28: added the project on Sourceforge and started using its services
for managing the project.

2000
----

Spring: major internal overhaul to provide a suitable library interface.
The first non-beta release was named 7.1 and arrived in August. This offered
the easy interface and turned out to be the beginning of actually getting
other software and programs to be based on and powered by libcurl. Almost
20000 lines of code.

June: the curl site moves to "curl.haxx.se"

August, the curl website gets 4000 visits weekly.

The PHP guys adopted libcurl already the same month, when the first ever third
party libcurl binding showed up. CURL has been a supported module in PHP since
the release of PHP 4.0.2. This would soon get followers. More than 16
different bindings exist at the time of this writing.

September: kerberos4 support was added.

November: started the work on a test suite for curl. It was later re-written
from scratch again. The libcurl major SONAME number was set to 1.

2001
----

January: Daniel released curl 7.5.2 under a new license again: 
[INFO] [MIT] :: MIT 
[INFO] [] :: (or
MPL).
[INFO] [MIT] ::  The MIT license 
[INFO] [] :: is extremely liberal and can be combined with GPL
in other projects. This would finally put an end to the "complaints" from
people involved in GPLed projects that previously were prohibited from using
libcurl while it was released under MPL only. (Due to the fact that MPL is
deemed "GPL incompatible".)

March 22: curl supports HTTP 1.1 starting with the release of 7.7. This
also introduced libcurl's ability to do persistent connections. 24000 lines of
code. The libcurl major SONAME number was bumped to 2 due to this overhaul.
The first experimental ftps:// support was added.

August: The curl website gets 8000 visits weekly. Curl Corporation contacted
Daniel to discuss "the name issue". After Daniel's reply, they have never
since got back in touch again.

September: libcurl 7.9 introduces cookie jar and `curl_formadd()`. During the
forthcoming 7.9.x releases, we introduced the multi interface slowly and
without many whistles.

September 25: curl (7.7.2) is bundled in Mac OS X (10.1) for the first time. It was
already becoming more and more of a standard utility of Linux distributions
and a regular in the BSD ports collections.

2002
----

June: the curl website gets 13000 visits weekly. curl and libcurl is
35000 lines of code. Reported successful compiles on more than 40 combinations
of CPUs and operating systems.

To estimate the number of users of the curl tool or libcurl library is next to
impossible. Around 5000 downloaded packages each week from the main site gives
a hint, but the packages are mirrored extensively, bundled with numerous OS
distributions and otherwise retrieved as part of other software.

October 1: with the release of curl 7.10 it is released under
[INFO] [MIT] ::  the MIT license
[INFO] [] :: 
only.

Starting with 7.10, curl verifies SSL server certificates by default.

2003
----

January: Started working on the distributed curl tests. The autobuilds.

February: the curl site averages at 20000 visits weekly. At any given moment,
there is an average of 3 people browsing the website.

Multiple new authentication schemes are supported: Digest (May), NTLM (June)
and Negotiate (June).

November: curl 7.10.8 is released. 45000 lines of code. ~55000 unique visitors
to the website. Five official web mirrors.

December: full-fledged SSL for FTP is supported.

2004
----

January: curl 7.11.0 introduced large file support.

June: curl 7.12.0 introduced IDN support. 10 official web mirrors.

This release bumped the major SONAME to 3 due to the removal of the
`curl_formparse()` function

August: curl and libcurl 7.12.1

    Public curl release number:                82

dnl XC_CONFIGURE_PREAMBLE
dnl -------------------------------------------------
dnl Public macro.
dnl
dnl This macro emits shell code which does some
dnl very basic checks related with the availability
dnl of some commands and utilities needed to allow
dnl configure script bootstrapping itself when using
dnl these to figure out other settings. Also emits
dnl code that performs PATH_SEPARATOR auto-detection
dnl and sets its value unless it is already set with
dnl a non-empty value.
dnl
dnl These basic checks are intended to be placed and
dnl executed as early as possible in the resulting
dnl configure script, and as such these must be pure
dnl and portable shell code.
dnl
dnl This macro may be used directly, or indirectly
dnl when using other macros that AC_REQUIRE it such
dnl as XC_CHECK_PATH_SEPARATOR.
dnl
dnl Currently the mechanism used to ensure that this
dnl macro expands early enough in generated configure
dnl script is making it override autoconf and libtool
dnl PATH_SEPARATOR check.

dnl XC_CHECK_PATH_SEPARATOR
dnl -------------------------------------------------
dnl Public macro.
dnl
dnl Usage of this macro ensures that generated configure
dnl script uses the same PATH_SEPARATOR check irrespective
dnl of autoconf or libtool version being used to generate
dnl configure script.
dnl
dnl Emits shell code that computes the path separator
dnl and stores the result in 'PATH_SEPARATOR', unless
dnl the user has already set it with a non-empty value.
dnl
dnl This path separator is the symbol used to separate
dnl or differentiate paths inside the 'PATH' environment
dnl variable.
dnl
dnl Non-empty user provided 'PATH_SEPARATOR' always
dnl overrides the auto-detected one.
dnl
dnl Strictly speaking the check is done in two steps. The
dnl first, which does the actual check, takes place in
dnl XC_CONFIGURE_PREAMBLE macro and happens very early in
dnl generated configure script. The second one shows and
dnl logs the result of the check into config.log at a later
dnl configure stage. Placement of this second stage in
dnl generated configure script will be done where first
dnl direct or indirect usage of this macro happens.

Currently building Curl using GNV takes longer than building Curl via DCL.
The GNV procedure actually uses the same configure and makefiles that
Unix builds use.

Building CURL on OpenVMS using GNV requires GNV V2.1-2 or the updated
images that are available via anonymous FTP at encompasserve.org in the gnv
directory.  It also requires the GNV Bash 4.2.45 kit as an update from the
same location or from the sourceforge.net GNV project.

The HP C 7.x compiler was used for building the GNV version.

The source kits are provided in backup savesets inside of the PCSI install kit.

Backup save sets are currently the only distribution medium that I can be
sure is installed on a target VMS system that will correctly unpack files
with extended character sets in them.  You may need to adjust the ownership
of the restored files, since /Interchange/noconvert was not available at the
time that this document was written.

[gnv.common_src]curl_*_original_src.bck is the original source of the curl kit
as provided by the curl project.  [gnv.vms_src]curl-*_vms_src.bck, if present,
has the OpenVMS specific files that are used for building that are not yet in
the curl source kits for that release distributed https://curl.se

These backup savesets should be restored to different directory trees on
an ODS-5 volume(s) which are referenced by concealed rooted logical names.

SRC_ROOT: is for the source files common to all platforms.
VMS_ROOT: is for the source files that are specific to OpenVMS.
          Note, you should create the VMS_ROOT: directory tree even if it is
          initially empty.  This is where you should put edits if you are
          making changes.
LCL_ROOT: is manually created to have the same base and sub-directories as
          SRC_ROOT: and VMS_ROOT:

The logical name REF_ROOT: may be defined to be a search list for
VMS_ROOT:,SRC_ROOT:

The logical name PRJ_ROOT: is defined to be a search list for
LCL_ROOT:,VMS_ROOT:,SRC_ROOT:

For the make install process to work, it must have write access to the
directories referenced by the GNU: logical name.

In future releases of GNV, and with GNV Bash 4.3.30 installed, this name
should be GNV$GNU:

As directly updating those directories would probably be disruptive to other
users of the system and require elevated privilege, this can be handled by
creating a separate directory tree to install into which can be referenced
by the concealed rooted logical name new_gnu:.  A concealed logical name of
OLD_GNU: can be set up to reference the real GNV directory tree.

Then a local copy of the GNU/GNV$GNU logical names can be set up as a search
list such as NEW_GNU:,OLD_GNU:

The directory NEW_GNU:[usr] should be created.  The make install phase should
create all the other directories.

The make install process may abort if curl is already because it can not
uninstall the older version of curl because it does not have permission.

The file stage_curl_install.com is used set up a new_gnu: directory tree
for testing.  The PCSI kitting procedure uses these files as input.

These files do not create the directories in the VMS_ROOT and LCL_ROOT
directory trees.  You can create them with commands similar to:

  $ create/dir lcl_root:[curl]/prot=w:re
  $ copy src_root:[curl...]*.dir -
    lcl_root:[curl...]/prot=(o:rwed,w:re)
  $ create/dir vms_root:[curl]/prot=w:re
  $ copy src_root:[curl...]*.dir -
    vms_root:[curl...]/prot=(o:rwed,w:re)

One of the ways with to protect the source from being modified is to have
the directories under src_root: owned by a user or resource where the build
username only has read access to it.


Note to builders:

GNV currently has a bug where configure scripts take a long time to run.
Some of the configure steps take a while to complete, and on a 600 Mhz
DS10 with IDE disks, taking an hour to run the CURL configure is normal.

The following messages can be ignored and may get fixed in a future version
of GNV.  The GNV$*.OPT files are used to find the libraries as many have
different names on VMS than on Unix.  The Bash environment variable
GNV_CC_QUALIFIERS can override all other settings for the C Compiler.

? cc: No support for switch -warnprotos
? cc: Unrecognized file toomanyargs
? cc: Warning: library "ssl" not found
? cc: Warning: library "crypto" not found
? cc: Warning: library "gssapi" not found
? cc: Warning: library "z" not found
u unimplemented switch - ignored


With these search lists set up and the properly, curl can be built by
setting your default to PRJ_ROOT:[curl.packages.vms] and then issuing
either the command:

  $ @pcsi_product_gnv_curl.com

or

  $ @build_gnv_curl.com.

The GNV configure procedure takes considerably longer than the DCL build
procedure takes.  It is of use for testing the GNV build environment, and
may not have been kept up to date.

The pcsi_product_gnv_curl.com needs the following logical names which
are described in the section below:

  gnv_pcsi_producer
  gnv_pcsi_producer_full_name
  stage_root
  vms_root1 (Optional if vms_root is on a NFS volume)
  src_root1 (Optional if src_root is on a NFS volume)

The pcsi_product_gnv_curl.com is described in more detail below.  It does
the following steps.  The build steps are only done if they are needed to
allow using either DCL or GNV based building procedures.

  $ @build_vms list

  $ @gnv_link_curl.com

  $ @build_gnv_curl_release_notes.com

  $ @backup_gnv_curl_src.com

  $ @build_gnv_curl_pcsi_desc.com

  $ @build_gnv_curl_pcsi_text.com

  $ @stage_curl_install remove
  $ @stage_curl_install

  Then builds the kit.

The build_gnv_curl.com command procedure does the following:

  $ @setup_gnv_curl_build.com

  $ bash gnv_curl_configure.sh

  $ @clean_gnv_curl.com

  $ bash make_gnv_curl_install.sh

  $ @gnv_link_curl.com

  $ @stage_curl_install.com

  $ purge new_gnu:[*...]/log

To clean up after a GNV based build to start over, the following commands are
used:

   $ bash
   bash$ cd ../..
   bash$ make clean
   bash$ exit

Then run the @clean_gnv_curl.com.  Use the parameter "realclean" if you are
going to run the setup_gnv_curl_build.com and configure script again.

   $ @clean_gnv_curl.com realclean

If new public symbols have been added, adjust the file gnv_libcurl_symbols.opt
to have the new symbols.  If the symbols are longer than 32 characters,
then they will need to have the original be exact case CRC shortened and
an alias in upper case with CRC shortened, in addition to having an exact
case truncated alias and an uppercase truncated alias.

The *.EXE files are not moved to the new_gnu: directory.

After you are satisfied with the results of your build, you can move the
files from new_gnu: to old_gnu: at your convenience.

Building a PCSI kit for an architecture takes the following steps after
making sure that you have a working build environment.

Note that it requires manually creating two logical names as described
below.  It is intentional that they be manually set.  This is for
branding the PCSI kit based on who is making the kit.

   1. Make sure that you have a staging directory that can be referenced
      by the path STAGE_ROOT:[KIT]

   2. Edit the file curl_release_note_start.txt or other text files to
      reflect any changes.

   3. Define the logical name GNV_PCSI_PRODUCER to indicate who is making
      the distribution.  For making updates to an existing open source
      kit you may need to keep the producer the same.

   4. Define the logical name GNV_PCSI_PRODUCER_FULL_NAME to be your full
      name or full name of your company.

   5. If you are producing an update kit, then update the file
      vms_eco_level.h by changing the value for the VMS_ECO_LEVEL macro.
      This file is currently only used in building the PCSI kit.

   6. Edit the file PCSI_GNV_CURL_FILE_LIST.TXT if there are new files added
      to the kit.  These files should all be ODS-2 legal filenames and
      directories.

      A limitation of the PCSI kitting procedure is that when selecting files,
      it tends to ignore the directory structure and assumes that all files
      with the same name are the same file, so every file placed in the kit
      must have a unique name.  Then a procedure needs to be added to the kit
      to create an alias link on install and remove the link on remove.

      Since at this time curl does not need this alias procedure, the steps
      to automatically build it are not included here.

      While newer versions of PCSI can support ODS-5 filenames, not all versions
      of PCSI on systems that have ODS-5 filenames do.  So as a post install
      step, the PCSI kit built by these steps does a rename to the correct
      case as a post install step.

   7. Edit the build_curl_pcsi_desc.com and build_curl_pcsi_text.com if you
      have changed the version of ZLIB that curl is built against.

   8. Prepare to backup the files for building the kit.

      Note that if src_root: or vms_root: are NFS mounted disks, the
      step of backing up the source files will probably hang or fail.

      You need to copy the source files to VMS mounted disks and create
      logical names SRC_ROOT1 and VMS_ROOT1 to work around this to
      reference local disks.  Make sure src_root1:[000000] and
      vms_root1:[000000] exist and can be written to.

      The command procedure compare_curl_source can be used to check
      those directories and keep them up to date.

         @compare_curl_source.com SRCBCK UPDATE

         This compares the reference project source with the backup
         staging directory for it and updates with any changes.

         @compare_curl_source.com VMSBCK UPDATE

         This compares the VMS specific source with the backup
         staging directory for it and updates with any changes.

         Leave off "UPDATE" to just check without doing any changes.

      If you are not using NFS mounted disks and do not want to have a
      separate directory for staging the sources for backup make sure
      that src_root1: and vms_root1: do not exist.

   9. Build the PCSI kit with @pcsi_product_gnv_curl.com

       The following message is normal:
          %PCSI-I-CANNOTVAL, cannot validate
            EAGLE$DQA0:[stage_root.][kit]VMSPORTS-AXPVMS-CURL-V0731-0-1.PCSI;1
          -PCSI-I-NOTSIGNED, product kit is not signed and therefore has
          no manifest file

       This will result in an uncompressed kit for the target platform.
       On Alpha and Integrity, the pcsi_product_gnv_curl.com can be used with
       the "COMPRESSED" parameter to build both a compressed and uncompressed
       kits.

Good Luck.
